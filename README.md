# Bottom-up Approach for translating Human Language to High-LevelRobot Language

## Problem Statement :pencil:

![](media/probstatement.jpg)

Our goal is to develop a bottom-up approach for translating English language instructions to High level Robot Instruction.

## Proposed Approach :bulb:

## Dataset :bookmark_tabs:
We use the dataset curated by ...

### Challenges in the dataset
The notion of directions was incorporated in the dataset. Any corridor can be traversed from either of the two opposite directions. (See example below)

```
O-4 ool C-1 nt O-4 K-0 H-2 N ; (Traversing corridor C-1 from the north direction)
O-4 oor C-1 nt O-4 K-0 H-2 S ; (Traversing corridor C-1 from the south direction)
``` 
This makes the behaviors **right** and **left** attributed. In the above example we have `ool` and `oor`

### Modifications in the dataset
To tackle the above challenge, we changed the dataset so that it fits well with our proposed approach. 

1. Firstly, we treated a particular corridor as seperate corridors when exploring from either directions.

```
O-4 ool C-1 nt O-4 K-0 H-2 N -> C-10
O-4 oor C-1 nt O-4 K-0 H-2 S -> C-11
```
2. To incorporate the notion of state or the path covered till now by the robot, we change the `data.answer` file in the [original dataset](). 
We break the translated path into various sets (as shown in the figure below) and treat the behaviors (colored in purple) as the labels of our modified dataset.

## Website :computer:
We built a working demo that takes in the following things as input, 
1. Natural Language Instruction
2. Behavioral Map encoding
3. Start Node

The output is the Robot Translation and a Graph View of the Behavioral Map.

## Accuracy :dart:
We got a training accuracy of **99%** on the training dataset and a test accuracy of approximately **82%** on the test dataset

## References and Credits :books:
This project was part of the course **CS613: Natural Language Processing** offered at **IIT Gandhinagar** under the guidance of **Prof. Mayank Singh**. We would also like our mentor **Praveen Venkatesh** for guiding and helping us throughout the project.
