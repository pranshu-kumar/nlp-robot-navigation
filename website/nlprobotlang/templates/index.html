    <!-- Abstract -->
    <!-- <h3 class="uk-text-center">Abstract</h3> -->

    <!-- <p class="uk-text-center">Advancements in technology have made it
                possible to have more efficient human-robot
                communication. NLP model can convert the
                human language instructions into high-level
                robot language; this helps us further improve
                the quality of human-robot interaction. Earlier
                in this domain, multiple attempts were made to
                tackle this problem. The most prominent work
                uses a technique of behavioral maps (which is
                a set of all possible actions a robot can take).
                The seq2seq model is used in this technique,
                which learns the high-level robot navigation
                language with the natural human language for
                a given set of behaviors. We intend to improvise the model by learning in a bottom-up fashion where we will
                learn chunks of the navigation or behavioural maps instead of learning
                the whole of it in one go. This approach will
                make it suitable for larger-sized environments
                as, in many cases, it might be unrealistic to
                have all the possible set of actions known from
                the beginning.
